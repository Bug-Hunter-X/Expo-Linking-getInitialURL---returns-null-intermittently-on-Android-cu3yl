# Expo Linking.getInitialURL() Intermittently Returns Null on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug where `Linking.getInitialURL()` in Expo's `Linking` API inconsistently returns `null` on Android devices, even when a deep link has been used to launch the app. This issue leads to unreliable deep link handling, preventing the app from properly processing the intended actions.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on an Android device or emulator.
3. Open a deep link targeting the app (as defined in the `app.json` file).
4. Observe that `Linking.getInitialURL()` sometimes returns `null` in the console, preventing the app from processing the deep link correctly.

## Potential Causes

- Possible race condition in the Android native code that handles the initial URL retrieval.
- Timing issues between the app launching and the URL being ready.

## Workaround (In bugSolution.js)
The provided solution implements a retry mechanism to handle these cases effectively.
